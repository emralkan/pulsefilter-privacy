Privacy Policy for PulseFilter
Last Updated: February 2026

At PulseFilter, we take your privacy incredibly seriously. Our application is designed to protect your inbox from spam, gambling, and fraudulent messages without compromising your personal data.

To provide our SMS filtering service, we utilize Apple's secure IdentityLookup and CoreML frameworks. Here is exactly how we handle your data:

1. Zero Data Collection
We do not collect, transmit, store, or share any of your personal SMS messages, phone numbers, contacts, or metadata.

2. On-Device Processing Only
Every single message that arrives on your device is evaluated locally within the secure sandbox of your iPhone.

Our CoreML Machine Learning models run 100% on your device's processor.
Your messages never leave your phone.
We do not have servers that read, store, or process your messages.
3. Apple's IdentityLookup Framework
PulseFilter integrates tightly with iOS via the ILMessageFilterExtension. When an unknown caller sends you a message:

iOS passes the sender ID and message body to PulseFilter purely in the background.
Our local rules (your whitelists/blacklists) and on-device AI model evaluate the text.
PulseFilter simply returns an action back to iOS (.junk or .none).
The message data is immediately discarded by our extension.
4. iCloud Synchronization
If you choose to use our Cloud Sync features, your custom blocked keywords and whitelisted senders are synchronized securely using your personal Apple iCloud account (NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore). We have no access to your iCloud account or the data stored within it.

5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
